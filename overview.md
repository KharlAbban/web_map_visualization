### The idea
A web map visualization that shows 3 critical factors needed by a sustainable city. It displays data that shows how sustainable a city or community currently is. <br />
The web map visualization not only display this data attractively, but combines it with data from other reputable sources to determine the exact problems causing a delay in these critical factors. <br />
For instance, the web map may show districts colored by levels of food security. Clicking a district or region fetches data on the agricultural production levels, livestock farming, soil health, population and access to water - different factors that contribute to food security. <br />
Seeing this detailed information will allow policy makers to understand which areas need attention and implement relevant policies to address those issues. <br />
The data being used is not static, and is updated automatically whenever the GSS StatsBank data source is updated. <br />

### More Info
This solution address the UN's SDG 11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities. <br />
To make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. <br />
The goals encompass and branch out into other SDGs such as SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6,8, and 12. <br />
As such, this solution only addresses a small subset of those issues. This gives it the potential to scale immensely by incorporating other SDGs and monitoring those efforts as well.

### Relevance
Policy makers see the problems going on as they move around. Having a centralised dashboard that informs them of the progress made in achieving susainable cities enablees them to determine which areas and which factors are causing bottlenecks in community and national development.
